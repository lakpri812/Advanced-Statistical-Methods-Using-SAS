In this project, I have analyzed a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study and performed various statistical tests and visualizations to investigate associations between different variables 
(e.g., hypertension and CVD, cigarettes per day and CVD), check for normality, and describe relationships between variables like BMI and glucose. Each part requires specific statistical methods, 
hypotheses, test statistics, p-values, and conclusions. 
Another dataset on dogs was analyzed and the differences in mean response between four different treatments in a study involving dogs was done by conducting both parametric and non-parametric tests 
for each pair of treatments, using a significance level of 0.004, to determine if there are any significant differences. Additionally, justification for the use of this specific significance level 
was also stated.
