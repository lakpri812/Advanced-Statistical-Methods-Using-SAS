The following questions were answered:
1) Fit a multiple linear regression model using all available predictors, perform regression diagnostics, and assess key regression assumptions using appropriate tests and plots.
2) If any regression assumption is not met, apply a suitable transformation to the model, explain the steps taken, and evaluate the fit of the transformed model using relevant tests and statistics.
3) Use the principle of extra sum of squares (type I and III SS) to identify and remove the least significant variables one at a time, and compare the tentative model with the initial model using appropriate tests and statistics.
4) Identify the best model(s) using adjusted R², Cp, and BIC criteria, and compare models obtained through stepwise, forward, and backward selection methods.
5) For one of the final models, report the coefficients of multiple determination, multiple correlation, partial correlation, and partial determination.
6) Demonstrate the alternative interpretation of the largest coefficient of partial determination in terms of the coefficient of simple determination by fitting appropriate models and calculating R², and similarly for the coefficient of multiple determination.
7) Use the final model to obtain 95% interval estimates for the mean response across the range of predictors, plot these intervals against each predictor, and add intervals for a new city's death rate and simultaneous confidence bands for the regression line, then compare the intervals.
