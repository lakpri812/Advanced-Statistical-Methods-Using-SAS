In this project I have used Monte Carlo simulations to verify that the type I error rate for a two-sided t-test is 5% under different conditions. 
Samples from three different distributions (Normal, Uniform, and t-distribution) with three different sample size settings were generated, 
and I performed the t-test 1,000 times for each combination, and reported the estimated type I error rates. Finally, these rates were compared to the 
nominal 5% level and discussed any discrepancies.
From the Framingham Heart Study data, I estimated the p-value of a goodness-of-fit test using Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 replicates and compared it to the p-value reported in the previous project for the same test. Additionally, this p-value was compared with the p-value from the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Linear Regression: detailed analysis of the relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and body mass index (BMI) using data from the Framingham 
Heart Study. Reported and interpreted various statistical measures and intervals, and compared different methods for estimating confidence intervals.
