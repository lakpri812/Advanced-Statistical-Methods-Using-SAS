The following questions were answered:
1) Fit a full model for predicting uric acid levels using all explanatory variables and identify the best model(s) using the adjusted RÂ² criterion.
2) For the best models, check all regression assumptions, detect outliers and influential points, and assess collinearity using appropriate diagnostic tools.
3) Fit a weighted least squares regression model with the same variables as the best model, iterate the process of estimating weights, and comment on the final results.
4) Use iteratively reweighted least squares for robust regression with the Bisquare weight function and MAD, perform at least three iterations, and compare residuals, weights, and regression coefficients across iterations, including those from the OLS model.

Bootstrap:
Fit a simple linear regression model of uric acid on triglycerides and use nonparametric bootstrap with at least 1,000 resamples to perform inference on
the regression coefficient, using both resampling of residuals and resampling of (X, Y). For each method, report the histogram and Q-Q plot of the 
bootstrap distribution, bias and standard error, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, and 95% confidence intervals using normal approximation, basic bootstrap, 
and percentile bootstrap, then compare these results with those from the simple linear regression output.

Logistic Regression:
Fit separate univariate logistic regression models for each predictor and select those with a p-value < 0.1, then fit a multiple logistic regression 
model with these predictors and use the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to iteratively refine the model by removing non-significant predictors until all 
remaining predictors are significant. Compare the final model with the full model using LRT, interpret the coefficients, and compare this model with 
one obtained using a stepwise procedure.
